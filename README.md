# miscarriage_methylation
Methylation analysis of EM and CV samples for cell composition to determine that whether the sampled tissue types are distinct and whether they correspond to the expected cell sample types.

## Pre-processing
1. SWAN preprocessing 

2. MethylumiNoob preprocessing for cell-type deconvolution (recommended method)


## Data visualisation / analysis

3. Global methylation by PCA
4. Average methylation per sample / methylation value distribution


## Cell-type deconvolution & visualisation
